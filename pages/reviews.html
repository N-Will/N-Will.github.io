				<p class="ybox review"><strong>John Doe</strong> We had a great time and we were very happy with our food and experience. The place was new to us and we really enjoyed being in a restaurant that had a team like feel. We know that many of the places are short staffed and we can see how hard all of the ladies and gentlemen are working so hard. Kuddos to the team. We will be back to enjoy another meal and the friendliness of the staff.</p>

				<p class="ybox review"><strong>Jane Doe</strong> For Dinner, we did take out, since the wait was 45-60 minutes for a table. The takeout time was also the same amount of time, but was a short walk from the hotel. Was a bit frustrated with the takeout process. I got there early to make sure that it wasn't going to be sitting around getting cold. Was told it was just getting out of the oven.</p>

				<p class="ybox review"><strong>Jane Doe</strong> Enjoyed a fantastic fresh seafood dinner tonight. Mom had the seared tuna steak over cheesy grits with avocado salsa. Loved every bite! She also enjoyed a side of southern cooked kale. I devoured seared sea scallops over mashed potatoes with vegetables and warm arugula. My belly is full and happy!!!    Yum</p>

				<p class="ybox review"><strong>Jane Doe</strong> I've ran out of good things to say my highest praies has been said so here is ann ad from their menu, Cal. 1100, $10.99. Ingredients: Spagahetti noodles, minced onions carrots celery and garlic, local raised beef minced, plum tomatoes imported directly from Italy, dried basil leaves, bay leaves, pur√©ed tomato, a deseeded red chilli chopped finely, simmered in red wine. This dish is a favorite among our Italian boorn coks and others alinke due to the rich nastalgic flavor.</p>
